# Custom Command

Adding custom commands to `Flutterw` is so easy with `command` package hook.

For Example, We want to use `scripts` shorthands, we can add a custom command with package [derry](https://pub.dev/packages/derry).

First, add derry to `dev_dependencies` in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  derry: latest
```

Then, add the custom command name (here we use `rs`) to derry under `hooks` in `flutterw.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  rs: derry
```

According to derry's usage documentation, we add some scripts to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
scripts:
  generate: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  build:aar: flutter build aar --no-debug --no-profile
```

Now, we can just run `flutterw rs generate`„ÄÅ `flutterw rs build:aar`.
