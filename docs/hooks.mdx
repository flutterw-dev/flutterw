# Hook Name

Each Flutterw command can be hooked with `pre_command`, `command` and `post_comand`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_clean:
  clean:
  post_clean:
```

## Sub command

For sub command, hooks' name is joined with underline `_`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_pub_get:
  pub_get:
  post_pub_get:
```

## Dashed command

For Dashed command, hooks' name should replace dash `-` to underline `_`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_build_ios_framework:
  build_ios_framework:
  post_build_ios_framework:
```
```

# Hook Type

Basiclly, hooks are executable shell scripts.

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_clean:
    - echo 'pre clean 1'
    - echo 'pre clean 2'
  clean:
    - echo 'clean'
  post_clean:
    - echo 'post clean'
```

## Package Hook

Besides shell scripts, a hook  can also be a dart package.

```yaml
hooks:
  clean: flutterw_clean
```

# Hook Scope

Hook scope can be project or global. 

## Project Hooks

Project hooks only be used within project, are configured in project's `flutterw.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_clean:
    - echo 'pre clean 1'
    - echo 'pre clean 2'
  clean: flutterw_clean
  post_clean:
    - echo 'post clean'
```
For package type hook in project scope (like `flutter_clean`), make sure `flutter_clean` is in `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_clean: any
```

## Global Hooks

Global hooks are shared cross projects. Currently only package hook is supported for global hooks.

```
# Install the hook package if not installed.
dart pub global activate flutterw_clean
# Set the package to global hook
flutterw hook add clean flutterw_clean -g
```

# Manage Hook

Shell scripts hooks can be managed by modifying project's `flutterw.yaml`

Package hooks can be managed by using `flutterw hook <subcommand>`.

```
> flutterw hook -h

Manage Flutterw Hooks.

Usage: flutterw hook <subcommand> [arguments]
-h, --help    Print this usage information.

Available subcommands:
  add      Add a hook
  list     List all hooks
  remove   Remove a hook

Run "flutterw help" to see global options.
```
