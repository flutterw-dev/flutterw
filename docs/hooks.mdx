# Hook Name

Each Flutterw command can be hooked with `pre_command`, `command` and `post_comand`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_clean:
  clean:
  post_clean:
```

## Sub command

For sub command, hooks' name is joined with underline `_`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_pub_get: # This is pre hook for command 'pub get'
  post_pub_get: # This is post hook for command 'pub get'
```

## Dashed command

For Dashed command, like `foo-bar`, hooks' name should replace dash `-` to underline `_`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_build_ios_framework: # This is pre hook for command 'build ios-framework'
  post_build_ios_framework: # This is post hook for command 'build ios-framework'
```

# Hook Type

Basiclly, hooks are executable shell scripts.

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_clean:
    - echo 'pre clean 1'
    - echo 'pre clean 2'
  clean:
    - echo 'clean'
  post_clean:
    - echo 'post clean'
```

## Package Hook

Besides shell scripts, a hook can also be a dart package.

```yaml
hooks:
  clean: flutterw_clean
```
**Note: make sure `flutterw_clean` is in `dev_dependencies` of project's `flutterw.yaml`.
