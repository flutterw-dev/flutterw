# Hook Name

Each Flutter command can be hooked with `pre:command`, `command` and `post:comand`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre:clean:
  clean:
  post:clean:
```

## Sub command

For sub command, hook name is command parts joined with colon(`:`)

```yaml
hooks:
  pre:pub:get: # This is pre hook for command 'pub get'
  post:pub:get: # This is post hook for command 'pub get'
```

# Hook Type

Basiclly, hooks are executable shell scripts.

```yaml
hooks:
  pre:clean:
    - echo 'pre clean 1'
    - echo 'pre clean 2'
  clean:
    - echo 'clean'
  post:clean:
    - echo 'post clean'
```

## Package Hook

Besides shell scripts, a hook can also be a dart package.

```yaml
hooks:
  clean: flutterw_clean
```
**Note: make sure `flutterw_clean` is in `dev_dependencies` of project's `pubspec.yaml`.


# Hook Args

Hook scripts dont take arguments from running command by default.

If a hook script needs to use the command arguments, use a `<args>` placeholder.

For example:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre:build:
    - dart ./scripts/pre_build.dart <args> # arguments passed to build command will be here.
  post:build:
    - dart ./scripts/post_build.dart <args> # arguments passed to build command will be here.
```

Package type hook will automatically add `<args>` placeholder when tranlated to script internally.
