# Getting Started

Flutterw requires a few one-off steps to be completed before you can start using it.

## Installation

Flutterw can be installed as a global package via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/):

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterw
```

### Setup

To set up your project to use Flutterw, create a `flutterw.yaml` file in the root of the project.

Within the `flutterw.yaml` file, add `hooks` fields:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_clean:
    - echo 'before clean'
  clean:
    - rm -fr .dart_tool
  post_clean:
    - echo 'after clean'
```

The `pre_command` hook scripts will be executed in order **before** command running.

The `command` hook scripts will be executed in order to replace original flutter command.

The `post_command` hook scripts will be executed in order **after** command running.


## Next steps

Besides shell scripts, you can set the took to a package listed in `dev_dependencies`.

Flutterw will internally tranlate the package to `dart pub run package`. 

For example, your `pubspec.yaml` has `flutterw_clean` in `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_clean: any
```
Then set hook `clean` to package `flutter_clean` in `flutterw.yaml`:
```yaml
hooks:
  clean: flutterw_clean
```

When running `flutterw clean`, package `flutterw_clean` will be executed.
